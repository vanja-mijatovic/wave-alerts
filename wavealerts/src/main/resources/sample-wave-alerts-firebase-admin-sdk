// Replace this file with your real Firebase SDK json

// This is a sample file that demonstrates how to set up the Firebase SDK in your project.
// Before you can use Firebase in your project, you need to obtain a Firebase SDK from the Firebase console.

// To obtain a Firebase SDK:
// 1. Go to the Firebase console (https://console.firebase.google.com/)
// 2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
// 3. Click on the gear icon next to "Project Overview" and select "Project settings".
// 4. Scroll down to "Your apps" and click on the "Add app" button.
// 5. Follow the prompts to register your app and download the Firebase SDK configuration file.

// Once you have obtained the Firebase SDK, replace this file with the actual Firebase SDK configuration file.
// Rename the configuration file to "firebase-config.js" and place it in the root directory of your project.

// After you have added the Firebase SDK configuration file to your project, you can initialize Firebase
// by adding the following code to your app's entry point:

// import firebase from 'firebase/app';
// import 'firebase/auth';
// import 'firebase/firestore';

// const firebaseConfig = require('./firebase-config.js');

// firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

// Note: Make sure to keep the Firebase SDK configuration file secret and don't share it publicly.
// If you're using version control, add "firebase-config.js" to your .gitignore file to prevent it from being committed.
